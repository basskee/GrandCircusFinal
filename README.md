# GrandCircusFinal
This is the capstone project for an eight week, full-time, front-end developer bootcamp at Grand Circus Detroit.
Kickstand is a prototype for an application that connects cyclists to local businesses and attractions along pre-mapped routes.
It supports an advertiser supported business model that generates traffic for the business and delivers special offers/experiences to cyclists.
You can view the live prototype at http://kickstandapp.github.io/
Follow the "Beers & Gears" or "Farm to Picnic Table" rides to experience the most functionality.
